* alloca()    For SAS/C 6.0 By H.Konishi.
*
* This routine was written by Stephen Walton, swalton@solar.stanford.edu,
* a rank asm amateur, to attempt to provide the alloca() function for Manx
* Aztec C on the Amiga.  It probably does horrible illegal things to the
* stack but seems to mostly work.
*
* This subroutine expects a single int as argument, and returns a pointer
* to a block of memory of that size allocated off the local stack.  Thus,
* this memory is automatically freed when the current subroutine exits.
*
* This version for the default Manx settings (int = 16 bits).  To use
* with int=32 bits, simply change both the ".w" to ".l"
